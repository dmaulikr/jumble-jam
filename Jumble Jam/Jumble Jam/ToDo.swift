// LOGIC
// create images - shuffled and first one removed
// create imageViews - assign shuffled images
// imageViews are moved -> does imageView image location match correct location?
// need to pass correct location with image to imageview

// GamePiece has image and correct location and current location




// - track location of each piece
// - track correct position of each piece
// - track coordinates of each imageview -> animate into place
// - move horizontal and vertical


// - consider moving gameboard logic to its own class
// - crop & resize user selected photos to use
